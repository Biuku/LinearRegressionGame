Getting stuck using trig. Also, trig is not how you do regression... though it's good in areas of pygame. Going to switch to using y = mx + b type math.


** A. Get the line equation for my line **

1. Implement 'slope' (b1) calculation -- keep degrees in the background, but swap out printr to show slope instead.
	- Calculate slope in arr, not pixels!
	- Well, maybe cross-check by doing both.  I think it should be the same.

2. Find y intercept (b0)
	- Use slope and any point on the line (mid):
	- y = b0 + b1·x
	- b0 = y - b1·x

^^^^^^^^ DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



** B. Use line equation to find vertical distances ***
	- Imagine an infinitely long version of my line -- that's the line equation
	- Line equation makes it easy to calculate delta y from an observation point to the imaginary long line.
		- Could even draw these.
	- y = b0 + b1·x
